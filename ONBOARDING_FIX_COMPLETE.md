## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Management (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Session token wasn't refreshed after API calls, causing stale data and incorrect redirects
- **Fix**: Added `await updateSession()` + 300ms delay after every critical onboarding step
- **Impact**: Ensures middleware has fresh session data for correct routing

### 2. Onboarding Page Routing
- **Issue**: Always redirected to `profile-setup` even if user was further along
- **Fix**: Read current step from database and route to correct page
- **Impact**: Users can now resume onboarding from where they left off

### 3. Guest Preferences Creation
- **Issue**: API tried to update non-existent `guestPreferences` record
- **Fix**: Changed to `upsert()` to create or update as needed
- **Impact**: Guest onboarding now completes without errors

### 4. Data Loading Race Conditions
- **Issue**: Multiple components fetching progress simultaneously
- **Fix**: Added proper loading state management and useRef guards
- **Impact**: Eliminated duplicate API calls and data inconsistency

### 5. Empty Interests Handling
- **Issue**: Guest couldn't skip interest selection
- **Fix**: Allowed empty interests array
- **Impact**: Better user experience with optional fields

## Files Modified

### Components
- `components/onboarding/steps/ProfileSetup.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/steps/RoleSelection.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/steps/guest/InterestSelection.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/steps/host/ListingWizard.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/steps/host/CollaborationSetup.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/steps/influencer/SocialMediaConnect.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/steps/influencer/ProfileMediaKit.tsx`

### Pages
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

### API Routes
- `app/api/onboarding/guest/interests/route.ts`

## Session Update Pattern

All onboarding steps now follow this proven pattern:

```typescript
// Update context
completeStep('step-name')
setStep(nextStep)

// Update session from database
await updateSession()

// Wait for session propagation
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300))

// Navigate
router.push('/onboarding/next-step')
// OR for final step:
window.location.href = '/dashboard/role'
```

## Verification

### Automated Testing
- Created `scripts/test-onboarding.ts` for comprehensive testing
- Tests all three user roles end-to-end
- Verifies data integrity at each step
- 100% test pass rate

### Manual Testing
- Build succeeds without errors
- All TypeScript types are correct
- No linting errors

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Monitor Session Updates**: Watch for any session-related errors in production logs
2. **User Analytics**: Track onboarding completion rates by role
3. **Performance**: Monitor the 300ms delay impact on UX (can be tuned if needed)
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with slow networks and concurrent sessions

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run automated onboarding tests
npx tsx scripts/test-onboarding.ts

# Run application
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
