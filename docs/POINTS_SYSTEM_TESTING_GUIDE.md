   - Try creating a 6th post today → Should NOT get points (daily limit reached)

### Test Scenario 4: Post Likes
1. **Like Someone Else's Post** (1 point, max 50/day)
   - Find a post from another user
   - Click the like button
   - You get +1 point
   - Post author gets +2 points

2. **Like Your Own Post** (0 points)
   - Find your own post
   - Try to like it
   - Should work BUT no points awarded (anti-abuse)

3. **Daily Limit**
   - Like 50 different posts
   - Try to like the 51st post → Should NOT get points

### Test Scenario 5: Comments
1. **Write Comments** (3 points, max 10/day)
   - Go to any post
   - Write a comment
   - You get +3 points
   - Post author gets +5 points (if not your post)

2. **Comment on Own Post** (3 points only)

### Test Scenario 6: Points Display

   - Should see ⭐ icon with your current points
   - Format: "123 points"

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Perform any action (like, comment, post)
   - Points should update immediately in the display

## 🔍 Verify in Database

To see all point transactions in the database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This opens Prisma Studio at http://localhost:5555 where you can:
1. Click "PointTransaction" table
2. See all point awards with:
   - User ID
   - Points awarded
   - Action type
   - Timestamp
   - Reference ID (post/comment ID)
   - Description

3. Click "UserPoints" table to see aggregate balances
4. Click "DailyCheckIn" table to see streak tracking

## 📊 Points Rules (Current Configuration)

| Action | Points | Daily Limit | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Signup** | 100 | N/A | One-time, highest value |
| **Onboarding Complete** | 75 | N/A | One-time |
| **Daily Check-In** | 10 | 1/day | Base points, streak bonuses available |
| **Booking Completed** | 50 | Unlimited | Revenue action |
| **Review Created** | 25 | Unlimited | Builds trust |
| **Property Created** | 30 | Unlimited | Supply side |
| **Post Created** | 15 | 5/day | Content creation |
| **Post Liked (giving)** | 1 | 50/day | Easy engagement |
| **Post Like Received** | 2 | 30/day | Popular content reward |
| **Comment Created** | 3 | 10/day | Community interaction |
| **Comment Received** | 5 | 20/day | Engaging content |
| **Follow User** | 2 | 20/day | Network building |
| **Follower Gained** | 3 | Unlimited | Organic reward |
| **Profile Completed** | 20 | N/A | One-time |

## 🛡️ Anti-Abuse Features Being Tested

1. **Daily Limits**
   - Try exceeding daily limits (e.g., like 51 posts)
   - System should silently stop awarding points after limit

2. **Self-Interaction Prevention**
   - Like your own post → No points
   - Comment on your own post → Only commenter points, not receiver points

3. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Like same post twice → Second like removes the like, no negative points

## 🎯 What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ Points display shows in navigation when logged in
- ✅ Points increase after each action
- ✅ Daily limits are enforced
- ✅ Check-in streak tracking works
- ✅ No points for self-interactions
- ✅ Database records all transactions correctly

### Potential Issues:
- ❌ Points display not showing → Check browser console for errors
- ❌ Points not increasing → Check Network tab for API errors
- ❌ Check-in button not responding → Verify /api/points/check-in endpoint
- ❌ Negative points → Should never happen, report if seen

  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"

# Get points history
curl http://localhost:3000/api/points/history?limit=10 \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"

  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"

# Daily check-in
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/points/check-in \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

## 🎉 Expected User Experience

A new user who:
1. Signs up → 100 pts
2. Completes onboarding → 175 pts total
3. Does daily check-in → 185 pts total
4. Creates 3 posts → 230 pts total
5. Likes 10 posts → 240 pts total
6. Writes 5 comments → 255 pts total
7. Receives 3 likes on their posts → 261 pts total

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Not Implemented Yet)

- Follow system points not integrated (would require finding follow routes)
- Booking and review points not integrated (would require finding those routes)
- Points history UI component (API works, just needs display component)
- Leaderboard UI (backend function exists)
- Points redemption system (points can only be earned, not spent yet)

**Dev Server:** Running at http://localhost:3000
**Prisma Studio:** Run `npx prisma studio` to open at http://localhost:5555
**Database:** PostgreSQL on Neon (connected)

Happy Testing! 🚀
